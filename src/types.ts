/**
 * Vocabulary this plugin merges into the harness's own type surfaces.
 *
 * Two declaration merges carry the whole durable contract:
 *
 * - `a2a/task` extends `SessionEventMap` so a task's state lives in the
 *   append-only log. `GetTask` after a restart therefore has an answer,
 *   which a process-local task table could never give.
 * - `a2aPeer` extends `MessageSourceMap` so an inbound message carries
 *   structured provenance instead of a warning string glued onto its text.
 *   The prose banner approach costs tokens on every message AND varies the
 *   reusable request prefix by peer name; a source field does neither.
 *

 * package free of a dependency whose own type surface targets a newer cordis

 * difference between "当前会话没有 shell、Web 抓取和本地文件系统读写工具" and
