`dsh-a2a-server` makes a [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)
agent reachable over the [A2A (Agent2Agent)](https://a2a-protocol.org) protocol. It
serves an Agent Card at a well-known URI and implements the **v1.0 JSON-RPC
binding**, so any compliant peer that knows the deployment's URL can discover the
agent and submit tasks to it.

The plugin is **inbound only**: it never connects to another agent. There is no
client, no peer directory, and no A2A subagent provider. It is a transport
adapter over `ctx.agents`, not a capability seam.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-a2a-server
```

`dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm inside the profile directory and appends this
bundle to `dsh.profile.bundles`, because the package declares `dsh.bundle`.

To work from a checkout instead, point it at the directory:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add ./path/to/dsh-a2a-server
```

| Requirement | Supplied by |
| --- | --- |
| `ctx.agents` | `dsh-base` |
| `ctx.credentials` | `dsh-base` |
| `ctx.webServer` | **`dsh-web-app`** |
| `ctx.sessionProjections` (optional) | composition; enables `GetTask` after settlement |

The plugin stays PENDING until the three required services exist. `ctx.webServer`
ships in `dsh-web-app` rather than `dsh-base`, so a `headless` profile needs
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-host-webserver` mounted before this bundle serves anything.
`dsh --profile <name> --dump-config` prints the composed rows.

## Quick start

The bundled example composition runs a real model and a listening server.

```sh
pnpm install
A2A_PEERS="alice:demo123" A2A_PORT=9922 pnpm serve
```

```powershell
$env:A2A_PEERS = "alice:demo123"
$env:A2A_PORT = "9922"
pnpm serve
```

Peer names are arbitrary — `alice` is this demo's default, not a protocol
fixture. Name as many as you like, and either carry the token inline or store it
under the derived credential reference:

```sh
A2A_PEERS="ops:tok1,research:tok2"   # inline
A2A_PEERS="ops,research"             # tokens from A2A_PEER_OPS / A2A_PEER_RESEARCH
```

The model credential is resolved through `ctx.credentials`, so an existing
`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in the harness home, either `.env` layer, or the process
environment is picked up unchanged. A missing credential fails the boot.

Fetch the card and submit a task:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9922/.well-known/agent-card.json

curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9922/a2a \
  -H "authorization: Bearer demo123" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'a2a-version: 1.0'   -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"SendMessage","params":{
        "message":{"messageId":"m1","role":"ROLE_USER",
                   "parts":[{"text":"hello"}]}}}'
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `A2A_PEERS` | `alice` | `name[:token]` list; a token is required for each |
| `A2A_PORT` | `9900` | Listening port |
| `A2A_SEND_MODE` | `block` | `block` or `immediate` |
| `A2A_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | temp dir | Parent of the per-peer working directories |
| `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` | `deepseek-v4-flash` | Model id requested from the adapter |

A one-shot probe runs 67 checks against a live server and exits non-zero on any
mismatch:

```sh
pnpm probe                                        # defaults to :9922 / demo123
node example/probe.mjs http://127.0.0.1:9922 demo123
```

## Interface

| Route | Method | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/.well-known/agent-card.json` | GET | Public by default |
| `/.well-known/agent.json` | GET | Public by default |
| `{basePath}` (default `/a2a`) | POST | Bearer required |

| JSON-RPC method | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `SendMessage` | Waiting negotiated per request |
| `SendStreamingMessage` | SSE |
| `GetTask` | Idempotent; answers after settlement |
| `ListTasks` | Cursor-paginated, filterable, resident contexts only |
| `CancelTask` | Cancels the running turn |
| `SubscribeToTask` | Live stream; `-32004` on a terminal task |
| `GetExtendedAgentCard` | Extra skills for an authenticated peer; `-32007` when unconfigured |
| `*TaskPushNotificationConfig` | `-32003` |

**Only A2A v1.0 is served.** The v0.3 method names, `kind` discriminators,
lowercase enums, and nested `file` parts are gone rather than aliased: every
reply this server writes is v1.0 JSON, which a v0.3 client could not read, so
answering a v0.3 request would fail further from its cause than refusing it. A
retired method answers `-32601` naming its replacement, and an explicit
`A2A-Version: 0.3` answers `-32009` (`VersionNotSupportedError`). A request with
no `A2A-Version` header is served as 1.0 — the only version this interface
declares on its card.

What that means concretely, against v0.3:

| Concern | v0.3 | v1.0 as served here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Task reference | `params.taskId` | `params.id` |
| `SendMessage` result | bare `Task` | `{ "task": … }` |
| Task state | `"working"` | `"TASK_STATE_WORKING"` |
| Message role | `"user"` | `"ROLE_USER"` |
| Part | `{"kind":"text","text":…}` | `{"text":…}`; file parts flatten to `url`/`raw`/`filename`/`mediaType` |
| Stream frame | `{"kind":"status-update",…,"final":true}` | `{"statusUpdate":{…}}`; the stream's close is the terminal signal |
| Stream opening | a non-final status update | the `Task` object itself |
| Wait control | `configuration.blocking` | `configuration.returnImmediately` (inverted; blocking is the default) |
| Card endpoint | `url` + `preferredTransport` | `supportedInterfaces[]`, each carrying its own `protocolVersion` |
| Card auth | `securitySchemes` + `security` | schemes wrapped in `httpAuthSecurityScheme`; `securityRequirements` |
| Extended card | `supportsAuthenticatedExtendedCard` | `capabilities.extendedAgentCard` |
| A2A error detail | none | `error.data[]` carrying a `google.rpc.ErrorInfo` with `reason` and `domain` |

Inbound messages may carry text, file, and data parts. File and data parts are
rendered into the model's context as bracketed references. Replies are text.

Authentication, rate limiting, and the trust gate answer with HTTP `401`, `429`,
and `403`; the body remains a valid JSON-RPC error envelope. A task belonging to
another peer answers exactly as an absent one.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `basePath` | `/a2a` | JSON-RPC route |
| `publicUrl` | derived from `Host` | Routable URL published on the card |
| `provider` · `model` | — | Model route for every agent this server creates |
| `card.public` | `true` | Serve the card without a credential |
| `card.skills` | `[]` | Declared skills; falls back to one `general` entry |
| `card.extendedSkills` | `[]` | Skills revealed only through `GetExtendedAgentCard` |
| `peers` | `{}` | Identity → credential **reference name** |
| `trustedPeers` | all authenticated | Allow-list of identities that may run tasks |
| `rateLimitPerMinute` | `60` | Sliding window per identity |
| `maxContextTurns` | `5` | Messages accepted per context before `rejected` |
| `sendMode` | `block` | Default when the client sends no `returnImmediately` |
| `blockTimeoutMs` | `60000` | After which a blocking request is declined |
| `contextIdleTtlMs` | `1800000` | Idle time before a context's agent is released |
| `maxResidentContexts` | `64` | Ceiling on resident contexts |
| `contextAuditPath` | `$DSH_HOME/a2a-context-audit.jsonl` | One JSON line per message: peer, whether a `contextId` was presented, and how it resolved. Empty string disables |
| `isolation.workspaceMode` | `per-peer` | `per-peer` or `shared` |
| `isolation.workspaceRoot` | — | Required; parent directory or shared cwd |
| `isolation.peerWorkspaces` | `{}` | Per-identity working-directory override |
| `push.enabled` | `false` | Reserved; see [Boundaries](#boundaries) |

Configuration is refused at load when `isolation.workspaceRoot` is absent, a peer
name is not `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*`, a `tokenEnv` is not a POSIX identifier,
`trustedPeers` or `peerWorkspaces` names an undeclared peer, or `basePath` does
not start with `/`.

### Conversation continuity

`contextId` is the conversation key, and continuity is the **peer's** choice:
omit it and the server starts a context, send it back and the conversation
continues. The registry holding resident contexts is process-local, so a context
the idle reaper or a restart forgot is recovered by resuming its durable
Session — `contextId` *is* the session id, and ownership is re-read from the
`a2a/task` rows in that session's own log before the peer is re-attached.

A context that cannot be resumed — another peer owns it, persistence is not
composed, or the session is genuinely gone — still gets a fresh context rather
than a failed send, because a peer that can never send again is worse than a peer
that gets a new conversation. Every outcome is one JSON line in
`contextAuditPath`, which is what tells a peer integration that never sends its
`contextId` back apart from a server that lost it:

```json
{"time":"…","peer":"alice","presented":true,"contextId":"9bd752eb-…","outcome":"resumed"}
{"time":"…","peer":"alice","presented":true,"contextId":"e38b9b44-…","outcome":"created-unresumable","newContextId":"9bd752eb-…"}
{"time":"…","peer":"alice","presented":false,"outcome":"created","newContextId":"9bd752eb-…"}
```

`resident` and `resumed` mean the peer kept its conversation; the two
`created-*` outcomes mean it was handed a new one, and only `presented:false`
puts the cause on the peer's side.

### Credentials

Configuration carries credential **references**, never values:

```yaml
peers:
  alice: { tokenEnv: A2A_PEER_ALICE }
```

```yaml
# ~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml
A2A_PEER_ALICE: <32-byte-hex-from-openssl-rand>
```

`ctx.credentials` resolves the reference per request across four layers — the
process environment, the managed document, `<cwd>/.env`, and `$DSH_HOME/.env` —
so rotating a token takes effect on the next request without a restart. Peer
identity comes from the presented credential only; nothing in a request body can
assert it. There is no shared bearer token: isolation is built on distinct
identities.

## Isolation

| Layer | Guarantee | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Model context | One peer's conversation cannot enter another's model request | Separate `contextId` → separate Session → separate log |
| Protocol access | A peer cannot read, continue, or cancel another's context or task | Ownership by authenticated identity |
| Tooling | A peer's agent cannot use tools to read another peer's session | `workspaceMode: per-peer` |

`per-peer` (the default) derives each identity's `cwd` from `workspaceRoot`.
`shared` places every peer in one directory, which suits peers collaborating on a
single repository; under it, files written by one peer are readable by another.

## Boundaries

- Inbound only. No outbound client, peer directory, or A2A subagent provider.
- JSONRPC binding only. gRPC and HTTP+JSON are not served, and the card says so.
- Push notifications are not implemented. `push.enabled` selects which error the
  push methods return; the card advertises `pushNotifications: false`.
- No `stateTransitionHistory`, protocol extensions, or card signatures.
- Streaming emits committed assistant messages. Per-chunk streaming is not
  implemented.
- No orphan-task watchdog: a task wedged non-terminal stays that way.
- Cross-session tool denial is not implemented; isolation rests on
  `workspaceMode`.
- A token ceiling settles a task as `completed`; the real turn ending travels in
  `Task.metadata.dsh.stopReason`, which A2A's state enum cannot express.
- Task state survives settlement but not a process restart: session persistence
  is not composed, so the projection has no log to cold-fold after a reboot.
- `ctx.webServer` provides no TLS. Any non-loopback exposure belongs behind a
  reverse proxy.
- A configuration change restarts the plugin and cancels in-flight tasks.

## Architecture

```
src/
├── protocol/          dependency-free library: no Cordis, no HTTP, no harness
│   ├── wire.ts        the A2A v1.0 vocabulary: one shape, no translation
│   ├── parse.ts       inbound parsing and the method table
│   ├── jsonrpc.ts     framing and the A2A error codes
│   ├── card.ts        Agent Card construction

├── router.ts          HTTP + JSON-RPC dispatch, free of Cordis so it unit-tests
├── contexts.ts        contextId -> Activation registry and residency policy
├── tasks.ts           task slots and the three-stage turn correlation
├── projection.ts      the a2aTask fold over the session log

├── config.ts          schema plus the cross-field checks that fail at load
└── types.ts           declaration merges into SessionEventMap / MessageSourceMap
```

**A task is an interval, not a turn.** One submitted message may span several
turns if tools queue more work, so settlement uses three hooks:
`agent/inbox/claimed` binds the message to a turn, `turn/end` records that turn's
ending, and `agent.whenIdle()` settles once the whole agent is quiet.

**Task state lives in the session log.** Lifecycle transitions are `a2a/task`
events; a projection unit folds them into the read model. The terminal edge
carries the committed output, so the fold serves the answer without reaching
back into message history.

**Residency is explicit.** HTTP has no connection lifetime, so each `contextId`
maps to an Activation evicted when idle, leaving the durable Session behind.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test       # 167 tests across 10 files
pnpm serve      # a listening server
pnpm probe      # 67 checks against a running server
pnpm build      # emit lib/
```

The end-to-end suites boot a real Cordis composition with a real agent loop and
drive it over HTTP, using a deterministic stub adapter so assertions do not
depend on model output.

## Relationship to the official project

Built against [deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

The official project supplies the agent runtime, the plugin system, and the
capability seams this plugin consumes. This project supplies:

- The A2A v1.0 JSON-RPC binding, served inbound
- Agent Card construction and inbound request parsing
- Mapping between A2A tasks and harness turns
- Per-peer authentication, isolation, and workspace policy

The harness is pre-release and does not promise compatibility across renames or
repackaging, so peer dependencies are pinned exactly to `0.1.0-rc.6`.
